I am able to connect to Spotify and stream music to these speakers / receivers from my PC and my mobile phone (Android). I was looking for a song on Spotify and did not find it active (it was greyed out), so I bought it on Amazon and downloaded the MP3's for the album.  I extracted the folder in Downloads and added the files after enabling local files.  I am able to play the files locally on my PC, but I am unable to listen to them on my connected speakers, even if I add them to a playlist and set it as the next song.  It just skips past it. Is this a rights isuse?  If so, I can provide recent proof of purchase ruling out the dumb Apple DRM issue from 10 years ago (not sure if it is something else, but the file does play fine on my desktop with different apps). I see a few people have had this issue, but I have not seen a fix for this.  I have also seen suggestions for this going back to 2014, but picking up massively since 2017.  I can only assume this is an issue on the client side and we are missing something?  Apologies if not, I am new to Spotify and the forums."

    "abstract": "Norway's Adevinta is buying eBay's (EBAY) classified ads business for $9.2 billion to create the world's largest online classifieds company. In the age of Google (GOOGL)and Facebook (FB), classifieds aren't exactly a mammoth business: They made up only about 3% of the $125 billion internet advertising market in 2019, according to the Interactive Advertising Bureau, the global industry body for digital advertising. But there was a day when Craigslist and the company that became eBay Classifieds were among the biggest advertising platforms on the newfangled World Wide Web. EBay Classifieds Group got its start 25 years ago — just as CNN Interactive (now CNN.com) went online and eBay was brought to life as AuctionWeb. EBay's classifieds business was first known as DBA, a popular Danish all-classifieds newspaper that started publishing in the 1970s. It tried its hand with the fledgling web in 1995 just months after \"Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web\" became Yahoo. EBay bought DBA (and a ton of other classifieds businesses around the world) in 2008 to form eBay Classifieds Group. But classifieds were never really core to eBay's ecommerce ambitions: Classifieds delivered revenue of just $248 million in the first quarter of 2020, or just over 10% of the company's total. With a history of spinning off non-core businesses (see: Skype, PayPal (PYPL) and StubHub), eBay decided to offload yet another as it struggles to keep pace with much-larger-rival Amazon (AMZN)."

    "abstract": "President Donald Trump said late Sunday that he was not told of intelligence that a Russian military spy unit offered bounties to Taliban-linked militants to attack coalition forces in Afghanistan, including U.S. troops, because U.S. intelligence officials did not find it credible. \"Intel just reported to me that they did not find this info credible, and therefore did not report it to me or @VP,\" Trump said in a tweet, referring to Vice President Mike Pence. He added that he considers such reports \"possibly another fabricated Russia Hoax\" spread by the \"Fake News ... wanting to make Republicans look bad!!!\". Earlier Sunday, Trump had tweeted that he had not been briefed about the intelligence, but he did little to clarify whether the administration was denying that the assessment existed or simply denying that he knew anything about it. The Washington Post reported Sunday that the Russian bounties offered to Taliban-linked militants to kill coalition forces in Afghanistan are believed to have resulted in the deaths of several U.S. service members, according to intelligence gleaned from U.S. military interrogations of captured militants in recent months. Several people familiar with the matter said it was unclear exactly how many Americans or coalition troops from other countries may have been killed or targeted under the program. The intelligence was passed up from the U.S. Special Operations forces based in Afghanistan and led to a restricted high-level White House meeting in late March, the people said. Asked to comment, John Ullyot, a National Security Council spokesman, said that \"the veracity of the underlying allegations continue to be evaluated.\" The CIA and the Defense and State departments declined to comment."

    "abstract": "Let me elaborate.  I was previously relying on a no-name 2-in-1 wireless charger from Amazon that powered both my iPhone XS and my Apple Watch Series 5. It did the job competently, but only barely. For one thing, it doesn’t support fast-charging on the iPhone. I had to lay the phone flat, so I couldn’t easily glance at the screen to unlock it and glimpse my notifications. And the Apple Watch charger was really just a stand with a hole for the charging puck that came with your wristwear. I still wound up with a rat’s nest of cables. As convenient as the setup was, it just didn’t really sell the appeal of wireless power. Logitech’s dock fixes all of those problems, and then some. Fast wireless charging is clearly helpful (yes, even with stay-at-home pandemic orders), but the real allure for me is a design that’s thoroughly well-considered. The vertical phone stand is helpful for checking my notifications at a glance, of course, but design touches like the rubbery finish and recessed floor make it easy to grab my phone or set it down. I want to use it because I’m never worried that I’ll accidentally send my phone clattering to my desk. The Apple Watch charger is a dedicated, raised puck that makes it easy to recharge at the end of the day. I haven’t had much need to use the flat charger, but it’s just large enough to fit a partner’s smartphone or a set of AirPods without worrying about locating the charging sweet spot. And did I mention that the only cable running from the back is a power cable? Hey, that matters if you’re determined to free up space. Just as important might be the lack of any major drawbacks. The matte black look (it’s also available in white) is clean and modern, but strictly functional. The Apple Watch charger could be slightly higher -- my larger-sized Sport Band drags on the desk. But that’s honestly all I could find to gripe about, and Logitech avoids frequent annoyances in this category like overly bright charging indicators (there’s just a tiny white light). The result is a wireless charger that does exactly what I’d hope for: it makes my mobile life easier without calling attention to itself. And for that, I’d say, the Powered dock is worth the money. It makes the most sense if you know you’ll use all three charging zones right from the outset, but it was still valuable for me even though I just used two. Is it still a luxury? You bet. But it’s one I appreciate every day, and it makes a convincing case for splurging on a premium wireless charger (not just Logitech’s) if you’re not sure that a run-of-the-mill pad will be enough. Whatever more you spend translates to reduced stress."

    "abstract": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, after days of intraparty disputes and splits spilling into public view, will move Thursday to unify Republicans behind their initial $1 trillion coronavirus relief proposal. There is now an agreement on funds for testing which marks a compromise between the Senate GOP and White House, and the payroll tax cut, a key priority for President Donald Trump, is officially out of the Republican draft. That marks a victory for Republicans, who had been public about their coolness to the idea.     Over the course of Thursday, the proposal will be rolled out in pieces by the key Senate Republicans on each section, finally setting the stage for long awaited negotiations just days before the expiration of crucial federal unemployment benefits.    Bottom line: The reality is, while progress has been made and a significant portion of Senate Republicans will line up behind the GOP draft, the Republican-on-Republican disputes are still very much alive -- and are likely to carry into GOP negotiations with Democrats in the days ahead.    Senior GOP aides predict those splits will dissipate, though not disappear, when Democrats get involved in the talks, but it remains an open question, particularly as one GOP senator told me on Wednesday, \"you never really know where the President is going to be on these things.\""

I am able to connect to Spotify and stream music to these speakers / receivers from my PC and my mobile phone (Android). I was looking for a song on Spotify and did not find it active (it was greyed out), so I bought it on Amazon and downloaded the MP3's for the album.  I extracted the folder in Downloads and added the files after enabling local files.  I am able to play the files locally on my PC, but I am unable to listen to them on my connected speakers, even if I add them to a playlist and set it as the next song.  It just skips past it. Is this a rights isuse?  If so, I can provide recent proof of purchase ruling out the dumb Apple DRM issue from 10 years ago (not sure if it is something else, but the file does play fine on my desktop with different apps). I see a few people have had this issue, but I have not seen a fix for this.  I have also seen suggestions for this going back to 2014, but picking up massively since 2017.  I can only assume this is an issue on the client side and we are missing something?  Apologies if not, I am new to Spotify and the forums."

Thursday's Department of Labor report hammered that point home: Another 1.4 million Americans filed for first-time unemployment benefits last week, marking the first increase in initial claims in 16 weeks.    The weekly first-time claims peaked at 6.9 million in the last week of March and fell continuously until last week, when the trend reversed. Economists had predicted claims would remain steady this week at 1.3 million, the same amount as in last week's report.   Nearly four months after the Covid-19 pandemic ravaged the health of Americans, their economy and their labor market, the upswing in economic data is tapering off.   A resurgence in infections and a rollback of reopening plans in several states is making it difficult for people to re-enter the labor force following the pandemic lockdown -- and it could derail the vulnerable US economic recovery."

While this ecosystem allows operators to pick from an array of solutions that meet their specific needs, there is one significant challenge that still remains for an operator planning to deploy multi-vendor Open RAN solutions: integrating these components from multiple vendors and making them deployment ready.Operators have a keen interest in making sure that not only do these open components work with each other, but that they are also able to interoperate with their existing network infrastructure. In an old traditional system, an operator would buy from one to two vendors. If the integration process did not go well, they could go with the other vendor and implement a duplicate strategy. This turnkey approach afforded them some flexibility in their networks, but as we saw in our discussion about fronthaul, might have closed proprietary interfaces.
