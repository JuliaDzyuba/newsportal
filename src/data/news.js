    "abstract": "President Donald Trump said late Sunday that he was not told of intelligence that a Russian military spy unit offered bounties to Taliban-linked militants to attack coalition forces in Afghanistan, including U.S. troops, because U.S. intelligence officials did not find it credible. \"Intel just reported to me that they did not find this info credible, and therefore did not report it to me or @VP,\" Trump said in a tweet, referring to Vice President Mike Pence. He added that he considers such reports \"possibly another fabricated Russia Hoax\" spread by the \"Fake News ... wanting to make Republicans look bad!!!\". Earlier Sunday, Trump had tweeted that he had not been briefed about the intelligence, but he did little to clarify whether the administration was denying that the assessment existed or simply denying that he knew anything about it. The Washington Post reported Sunday that the Russian bounties offered to Taliban-linked militants to kill coalition forces in Afghanistan are believed to have resulted in the deaths of several U.S. service members, according to intelligence gleaned from U.S. military interrogations of captured militants in recent months. Several people familiar with the matter said it was unclear exactly how many Americans or coalition troops from other countries may have been killed or targeted under the program. The intelligence was passed up from the U.S. Special Operations forces based in Afghanistan and led to a restricted high-level White House meeting in late March, the people said. Asked to comment, John Ullyot, a National Security Council spokesman, said that \"the veracity of the underlying allegations continue to be evaluated.\" The CIA and the Defense and State departments declined to comment."

    "abstract": "Let me elaborate.  I was previously relying on a no-name 2-in-1 wireless charger from Amazon that powered both my iPhone XS and my Apple Watch Series 5. It did the job competently, but only barely. For one thing, it doesn’t support fast-charging on the iPhone. I had to lay the phone flat, so I couldn’t easily glance at the screen to unlock it and glimpse my notifications. And the Apple Watch charger was really just a stand with a hole for the charging puck that came with your wristwear. I still wound up with a rat’s nest of cables. As convenient as the setup was, it just didn’t really sell the appeal of wireless power. Logitech’s dock fixes all of those problems, and then some. Fast wireless charging is clearly helpful (yes, even with stay-at-home pandemic orders), but the real allure for me is a design that’s thoroughly well-considered. The vertical phone stand is helpful for checking my notifications at a glance, of course, but design touches like the rubbery finish and recessed floor make it easy to grab my phone or set it down. I want to use it because I’m never worried that I’ll accidentally send my phone clattering to my desk. The Apple Watch charger is a dedicated, raised puck that makes it easy to recharge at the end of the day. I haven’t had much need to use the flat charger, but it’s just large enough to fit a partner’s smartphone or a set of AirPods without worrying about locating the charging sweet spot. And did I mention that the only cable running from the back is a power cable? Hey, that matters if you’re determined to free up space. Just as important might be the lack of any major drawbacks. The matte black look (it’s also available in white) is clean and modern, but strictly functional. The Apple Watch charger could be slightly higher -- my larger-sized Sport Band drags on the desk. But that’s honestly all I could find to gripe about, and Logitech avoids frequent annoyances in this category like overly bright charging indicators (there’s just a tiny white light). The result is a wireless charger that does exactly what I’d hope for: it makes my mobile life easier without calling attention to itself. And for that, I’d say, the Powered dock is worth the money. It makes the most sense if you know you’ll use all three charging zones right from the outset, but it was still valuable for me even though I just used two. Is it still a luxury? You bet. But it’s one I appreciate every day, and it makes a convincing case for splurging on a premium wireless charger (not just Logitech’s) if you’re not sure that a run-of-the-mill pad will be enough. Whatever more you spend translates to reduced stress."
